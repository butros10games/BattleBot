Project Name: NatureTech

## Coding Standards Document

1. Introduction

    1.1 Purpose
    This document defines the coding standards and best practices to be followed when developing the [Your Project Name] Django application.

    1.2 Scope
    These coding standards apply to all developers working on the project and encompass both Python and Django-related coding guidelines.

2. Python Coding Standards

    2.1 PEP 8 Compliance
    All Python code should adhere to the PEP 8 style guide. Use an automated linter such as `flake8` or `pylint` to enforce compliance.

    2.2 Naming Conventions
    - Use descriptive variable and function names.
    - Use lowercase with underscores for variable and function names (e.g., `my_variable`, `my_function`).
    - Use `CamelCase` for class names (e.g., `MyClass`).
    - Use all-uppercase for constants (e.g., `MY_CONSTANT`).

    2.3 Imports
    - Group imports in the following order: standard library imports, third-party library imports, and local application imports.
    - Use absolute imports rather than relative imports.
    - Avoid using wildcard imports (`from module import *`).
    - When importing a new module in the project eddit the `requirements.txt` file to include the new module.

    2.4 Code Documentation
    - Include docstrings for classes, functions, and modules.
    - Follow the NumPy/SciPy documentation style for docstrings.

3. Testing

    4.1 Unit Tests
    - Write unit tests for all critical parts of the code.
    - Use Django's testing framework.
    - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern in your test functions.

    4.2 Integration Tests
    - Write integration tests for interactions between different parts of the application.
    - Use appropriate fixtures for test data.

4. Version Control

    5.1 Git
    - Use Git for version control.
    - Follow a trunk strategy.
    - Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
    - Follow the commit [template](/docs/commit_template.md).
    - Look at the review of your push before merging to the master branch and make the changes.

5. Documentation

    6.1 Code Comments
    - Include comments for non-trivial code sections.
    - Comment code that may be less obvious to other developers.

    6.2 API Documentation
    - Document API endpoints using tools like Swagger or Django REST framework's built-in documentation.

6. Security

    7.1 Authentication and Authorization
    - Implement proper user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    - Be aware of common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) and follow best practices to mitigate them.

    7.2 Data Validation
    - Validate user inputs and sanitize data to prevent security risks.
    - Use Django's built-in tools for handling user input securely.

7. Continuous Integration and Deployment

    8.1 CI/CD Pipeline
    - Set up a continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline.
    - Automate testing, linting, and deployment processes.

8. Conclusion

    9.1 Review and Compliance
    All developers working on the project are expected to adhere to these coding standards. Code reviews should ensure compliance.

    9.2 Updates
    This document may be updated as needed to reflect changes in coding standards and best practices.

By following these coding standards, we aim to maintain code consistency, readability, and quality throughout the development of the NatureTech Django application.
